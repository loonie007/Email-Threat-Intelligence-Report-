## üß≠ Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Email Threat Intelligence** investigation focused on analysing and mitigating a phishing-based cyber incident.  
It demonstrates the process of identifying, examining, and responding to a suspicious email impersonating Microsoft using both manual inspection and automated threat intelligence tools.

The project serves as a professional case study in **email forensics**, **incident response**, and **cyber threat intelligence** operations within a Security Operations Centre (SOC) context.

## üéØ Objective

The objectives of this analysis are to:

- Conduct a full forensic investigation of a phishing email.  
- Demonstrate advanced techniques for analysing email headers and body content.  
- Cross-reference indicators of compromise (IOCs) using multiple threat intelligence sources.  
- Provide actionable recommendations to enhance email security and user awareness.

## üß† Executive Summary

On **03 October 2025**, the Security Operations Centre (SOC) received a suspicious email reported by an employee.  
The email impersonated Microsoft, urging the recipient to verify their account through a malicious link.

The investigation confirmed that:

- The sender domain `access-accsecurity.com` is unaffiliated with Microsoft.  
- SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication failed across all checks.  
- The originating IP `89.144.44.41` was traced to a non-Microsoft network.  
- Malicious domains `sign.in` and `thebandalisty.com` were identified as phishing and tracking sources.  

All indicators of compromise (IOCs) were blocked across both network and endpoint layers.  
No user compromise was detected following the incident.
